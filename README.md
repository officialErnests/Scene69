# The Best of All Possible Snowdrifts
## welcome to the most chilling place around bringing cold from the dead tomb
In here there is never ending snow storm as each step is quickly hidden by layers of snow
grab a warm chocklet as you are bit snowbound
will include big clickable snow piles (hopefully)
the loore is that it never stops snowing as snow piles are so hig that form next to buildings and makes website hard to travers as snow is everywhere
leave with snow mobile to 74
and leave with a guid trogh snowy mountains as you explore the caves in order to go to 28
> a jurney trough the mountains 28 (with guid as well gameplay elements [a chat with him for lore for this place while you walk])

> a jurney to 74(insert snow mobile here)

as well i will try to create as much art as posible by hand as well no ai since i love hand crafted webistes ;;))
